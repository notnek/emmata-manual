                        <li>A rally is the period during which the ball is in play.</li>
                        <li>The ball is in play from the last moment at which it is stationary on the palm of the free hand before being intentionally projected in service until it touches anything other than the playing surface, the net assembly, the racquet held in the racquet hand or the racquet hand below the wrist, or until the rally is otherwise decided a let or a point.</li>
                        <li>A let is a rally of which the result is not scored.</li>
                        <li>A point is a rally of which the result is scored.</li>
                        <li>The racquet hand is the hand carrying the racquet.</li>
                        <li>The free hand is the hand not carrying the racquet.</li>
                        <li>A player strikes the ball if he touches it in play with their racquet, held in the racquet hand, or with their racquet hand below the wrist.</li>
                        <li>A player obstructs the ball if he or anything he wears or carries, touches it in play when it is traveling toward the playing surface and has not passed beyond the end line, not having touched their court since last being struck by their opponent.</li>
                        <li>The server is the player due to strike the ball first in a rally.</li>
                        <li>The receiver is the player due to strike the ball second in a rally.</li>
                        <li>Anything that a player wears or carries includes anything that he was wearing or carrying at the start of the rally.</li>
                        <li>The ball shall be regarded as passing over or around the net assembly if it passes under or outside the projection of the net assembly outside the table.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Service
                    <ol>
                        <li>Service shall start with the ball resting freely on the open palm of the server's free hand.</li>
                        <li>The server shall then project the ball near vertically upwards, without imparting spin.</li>
                        <li>As the ball is falling, the server shall strike it so that it touches first their court and then, passing directly over or around the net assembly touches the receiver's court.</li>
                        <li>Whenever there is a clear failure to comply with the requirements for a good service, the receiver shall score a point.</li>
                        <li>If, in attempting to serve, a player fails to strike the ball while it is in play, their opponent will be awarded a point.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>A Good Return
                    <ol>
                        <li>The ball, having been served or returned in play, shall be struck so that it passes directly over or around the net assembly and touches the opponent's court, either directly or after touching the net assembly.</li>
                        <li>If the ball, having been served or returned in play, returns with its own impetus over the net, it may be struck so that it touches directly the opponent's court.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Order of Play

                        <li>The server shall first make a good service, the receiver shall then make a good return, and thereafter, server and receiver alternately shall each make a good return.</li>
                    </ol>

                        <li>If the service is delivered when the receiving player or pair is not ready, provided that neither the receiver nor their partner attempts to strike the ball.</li>
                        <li>If the failure to make a good service or a good return or otherwise to comply with the Manual is due to a disturbance outside the control of the player.</li>

                        <li>If their opponent, or anything he wears or carries, touches the net assembly.</li>
